## Ajax - Asynchronous JavaScript and XML

* Allows us to make subsequent requests even after a page has loaded.
* Often results in a performance boost (perceived, in networking, and in execution time)
* Can load new data without a pageload
* Reduce server-side load / client works harder
* It doesn't matter what you have on the back-end, as long as it can understand the request!


## Are there downsides?

* Dynamic content can be trickier
* Async code can be harder to write / troubleshoot
* `XMLHttpRequest` or `fetch` must be available in the browser
